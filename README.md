NebulOuS is an innovative Meta Operating System designed to facilitate secure and efficient application provisioning and reconfiguration within the cloud computing continuum. The system effectively brokers resources from a diverse cloud continuum, spanning from the far edge to public and private cloud offerings, as well as processing nodes with significant capacity in between. NebulOuS can handle from container-based and VM-based deployments to "raw" bare metal deployments. Additionally, NebulOuS not only supports "serverful" approaches but also embraces the serverless paradigm, empowering users to optimize function execution.
